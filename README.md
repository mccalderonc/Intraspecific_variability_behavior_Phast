# Intraspecific variability of social structure and linked foraging behavior in a widespread bat species

The following code test social foraging behavior at different sections of a bat foraging trajectory. Our results is compared to the behavior of P. hastatus Trinidad population (McCracken and Bradbury, 1981; Wilkinson and Boughman 1998), to better understand the extent of intraspecific variation in sociality among P. hastatus. 

In thiscode we renamed the initial name of the groups to avoid misunderstanding with the figure labeling of the manuscript, as follows:
Group D= Group F1
Group G= Group F2
Group DG= Group F1F2
Group B= Group F3
Group C1= Group F4

The code should be run as follows:

1.CleaningData_Bocas2022.Rmd

2.CleaningData_2016.Rmd

3.Merge_alldata.Rmd

4.Behavioral_classification.Rmd

5.Group_counts.Rmd

6.Coordination_departures_returns.Rmd

7.Path_similarity_dtw.Rmd

8.Overlap_between_groups.Rmd

9.Activity_budgets.Rmd

Note: for parts of the code either movebank accounts credentials, or stadiamps keys are needed.
